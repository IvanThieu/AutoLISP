# AutoLISP

LISP routines to implement with AutoCAD and AutoCAD Civil 3D

Some of these LISP routines are meant to be used in combination with other tools such as:
  - AutoHotKey or Aliases in AutoCAD to simplify the command or bind it to a key
  - Custom dll files created using C# (AutoCAD .NET API)
  - Common lisp routines found online
